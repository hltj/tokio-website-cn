Feel free to skip this section, and just use `features = ["full"]` while
learning. This section provides some examples of how and when to choose
specific [`feature groups`] in `Cargo.toml`.

## Often using all features is fine

When writing an app, we'll often use all of Tokio's features to accelerate
our development time.

Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

For most apps, the additional compile time is hardly noticeable relative to the
cognitive overhead of thinking about which features are needed.

# Selecting features

When we develop protocol implementations that are used by client apps and
servers, we want to limit the dependencies to decrease compile time --
not just for us, but also for the users of our crates.

Let's take a look at our tiny client app and see what features are needed.

## tokio main

If we replace our `src/main.rs` with following code (only adding the
`#[tokio:main]` macro to the default hello world generated by `cargo new`):

main.rs:
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("doing nothing yet");
}
```

Then we can choose whether to use threads (commonly used for servers):

```toml
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["macros", "rt-threaded"] }
```

or lightweight cooperative multi-tasking
(often required for low-profile clients):

```toml
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["macros", "rt-core"] }
```

## TcpStream connect

As we start to build the app, we'll need more features.  The line of code
where we call `TcpStream::connect` requires two features:


```rust,no_run
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# #![allow(unused_mut)]
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
# use tokio::net::TcpStream;
# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() {
    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:6142").await.unwrap();
# }
```


1. `dns` for converting the string `127.0.0.1:6142` to an IP address -- Tokio
will need to do a DNS lookup just in case.
2. `tcp` for handling the TCP connection


Since our example uses a specific ip address, we can reduce dependendencies
further by creating a [`std::net::SocketAddr`]:

```rust,no_run
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# #![allow(unused_mut)]
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
use std::net::{IpAddr, Ipv4Addr, SocketAddr};
use tokio::net::TcpStream;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let addr = SocketAddr::new(IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 6142);
  let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(addr).await.unwrap();
}
```

## Writing to the socket

The `write` method is defined in [`tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt`] which requires
`io-util`.

```rust,no_run
# #![deny(deprecated)]
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
# use tokio::net::TcpStream;
# use tokio::prelude::*;
# #[tokio::main]
# async fn main() {
#    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:6142").await.unwrap();
    let result = stream.write(b"hello world\n").await;
# }

```

The `write` method in our example is declared with `use tokio::prelude::*`.
The [`tokio prelude`] follows the [`Rust prelude pattern`] to make using
multiple types more convenient.  We could be more explicit by declaring `use tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt`:

If anything missing, please [`open an issue`] and one of the Tokio elves
will figure out where it is declared and will fix it asap!
